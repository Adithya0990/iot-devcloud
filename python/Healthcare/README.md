### Brain Tumor Segmentation Sample

The Brain Tumor Segmentation Sample demonstrates the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit in a healthcare use-case. The U-Net architecture is used to model and predict the location of brain tumors, and the Intel® DevCloud is used to accelerate inferencing across Intel® edge hardware.  

The healthcare_openvino example features the OpenVINO™ Model Optimizer and Inference Engine, which optimize deep learning models for Intel® architecture. 

The healthcare_no_openvino example features MKL-DNN, which optimizes frameworks such as TensorFlow for Intel® architecture.
