### Brain Tumor Segmentation Sample

The Brain Tumor Segmentation Sample demonstrates the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit preformance optimization in a healthcare use case. The U-Net architecture is used to model and predict the location of brain tumors.

The **healthcare_openvino** example features the brain tumor segmentation model optimized with OpenVINO™ Model Optimizer and run with Inference Engine. 

For performance comparison, there is the **healthcare_no_openvino** example featuring MKL-DNN, which optimizes frameworks such as TensorFlow for Intel® architecture.
