    "# Object Detection Demo: Car Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sample reference implementation to showcase Object detection (car in this case) with SSD and Async API.\n",
    "Async API improves the overall frame-rate of the application by not waiting for the inference to complete but continue doing things ont he host while accelerator is busy. \n",
    "Specifically, this code demonstrates two parallel infer requests by processing the current frame while the next input frame is being captured. This essentially hides the latency of capturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of How it works?\n",
    "The inference executable (tutorial1) reads the command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. \n",
    "A job must be submitted to run the inference executable on a hardware accelerator (Intel® Core CPU, Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Core CPU, Intel® Movidius™ and/or Neural Compute Stick).\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results directory which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",
    "* Inference performed actual Edge hardware\n",
    "* **OpenCV** provides the bounding boxes, labels and other information\n",
    "* Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes\n",
    "* Demonstrate the Async API in action\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Compile the code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this demo is separated into two parts.\n",
    "First part is responsible for reading the input stream and running the object detection inference workload on the stream. \n",
    "This part outputs Region Of Interest (ROI), in terms of coordinates, for each frame.\n",
    "The source code for this part can be found in [main.cpp](./main.cpp), and the executable will be named \"tutorial1\".\n",
    "Output ROI will be written into a text file, \"ROIs.txt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part reads the ROIs.txt file, and overlays boxes on each frame of the stream based on the coordinates.\n",
    "Then the output video is written into a file. \n",
    "The source code for this step is in [ROI_writer.cpp](./ROI_writer.cpp).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a Makefile for compiling the examples. Run the following cell to compile the application.\n",
    "(tip: use **crtl+enter** to run the cell)"
